    FISP3D{T, Ns, U<:AbstractVector} <: EPGSimulator{T,Ns}

This struct is used to simulate gradient-spoiled sequence with varying flip angle
scheme and adiabatic inversion prepulse using the EPG model for 3D sequences. The TR and TE are fixed throughout
the sequence. Unlike the 2D case, no slice profile correction is applied. However, for
3D acquisitions, slab correction may be necessary. To accomplish this, the B₁ parameter
can be modified per voxel instead. For 3D, the sequence will likely be repeated many times. After
a certain number of repetitions (usually five is enough), a "hyper" steady state is reached. We only sample
in this hyper steady state.

Within each TR, a single time steps is used to simulate the RF excitation. Then, in one time step we go from the
end of the RF excitation to the echo time (applying T₁ and T₂ decay, T₁ regrowth and B₀ rotation), and again
in one time step from the echo time to the start of the next RF excitation.

# Fields
- `RF_train::U` Vector with flip angle for each TR with abs.(RF_train) the RF flip angles in degrees and
    angle.(RF_train) should be the RF phases in degrees.
- `sliceprofiles::V` # Matrix with RF scaling factors (a.u.) to simulate slice profile effects.
    Each column represents the (flip angle dependent) scaling factors for one position along the slice direction.
- `TR::T`: Repetition time in seconds, assumed constant during the sequence
- `TE::T`: Echo time in seconds, assumed constant during the sequence
- `max_state::Val{Ns}`: Maximum number of states to keep track of in EPG simulation
- `TI::T`: Inversion delay after the inversion prepulse in seconds
- `TW::T`: Waiting time between repetitions in seconds
- `repetitions::Int`: Number of repetitions
- `inversion_prepulse::Bool`: With or without inversion prepulse at the start of every repetition
- 'wait_spoiling::Bool': Spoiling is assumed before the start of a next cycle
