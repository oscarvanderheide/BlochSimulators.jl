    SpokesTrajectory{T} <: AbstractTrajectory{T}

Typical Cartesian and radial trajectories have a lot in common: a readout
can be described by a starting point in k-space and a Î”k per sample point.
To avoid code repetition, both type of trajectories are made a subtype of
SpokesTrajectory such that some methods that would be the same for both
trajectories otherwise are written for SpokesTrajectory instead.
