    pSSFP2D{T<:AbstractFloat,N,M,U<:AbstractVector{Complex{T}},V<:Number} <: IsochromatSimulator{T}

This struct is used to simulate a inversion-recovery, gradient-balanced transient-state sequence with varying flip angle scheme based on the isochromat model. The TR and TE are fixed throughout the sequence. The TR and TE are fixed throughout the sequence. Slice profile correction
is done by discretizing the RF excitation waveform in time and using multiple `Isochromat`s with different
positions along the slice direction (`z`) per voxel. The sequence also uses an 'α/2' prepulse after the inversion.

Within each TR, multiple time steps are used to simulate the RF excitation. Then, in one time step we go from the
end of the RF excitation to the echo time (applying slice refocussing gradient, T₂ decay and B₀ rotation), and again in one time step from the echo time to the start of the next RF excitation.

# Fields
- `RF_train::U` Vector with flip angle for each TR with abs.(RF_train) the RF flip angles in degrees and
    angle.(RF_train) should be the RF phases in degrees.
- `TR::T`: Repetition time in seconds, assumed constant during the sequence
- `γΔtRF::SVector{N}{V}`: Time-discretized RF waveform, normalized to flip angle of 1 degree
- `Δt::NamedTuple{(:ex, :inv, :pr),NTuple{3,T}}`: Time interval for each sample of excitation pulse (ex),
    inversion delay (inv) and time between RF and TE (pr)
- `γΔtGRz::NamedTuple{(:ex, :inv, :pr),NTuple{3,T}}`: Slice select gradients for ex, inv and pr
- `z::SVector{M}{T}` # Vector with different positions along the slice direction.
